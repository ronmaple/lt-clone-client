# Linktree (lt) clone Front-end app

- Completely from scratch.

Helpful resources:

- Authentication with Auth0, full-stack: https://auth0.com/blog/develop-modern-apps-with-react-graphql-apollo-and-add-authentication/
- There might be better, more abstracted ways to run authentication, but this was the one I wanted to learn a bit more of.

## Architecture

- Todo

## Development Setup

To run locally, you need a `.env.development` at root level.

- `PORT` or defaults to `8080`
- `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`
- `AUTH0_CLIENT_DOMAIN`
- `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`

## TODO's

- Replace `browser-sync` dev server. It's too slow
